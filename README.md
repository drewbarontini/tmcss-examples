"Thinking Modular CSS" Example Sites
====================================

Confusion?
----------

Check out the [MVCSS documentation](http://mvcss.github.io/) if anything feels strange. Everything is explained there :)

Setup
-----

You can just open up the `index.html` files in your browser (only tested in Google Chrome latest), but if you want to make any changes to the Sass, you'll need to set up Grunt and have it watch your project for changes.

```bash
# Install grunt cli globally
npm install -g grunt-cli

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run Grunt to watch your Sass files
grunt
```
